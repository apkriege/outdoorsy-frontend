This is a simple SPA that uses the Outdoorsy API to search for RVs and display them in a list. The user can then click on a listing to see more details about the RV. The user can also filter the results.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
